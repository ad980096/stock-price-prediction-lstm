# stock-price-prediction-lstm
This project predicts stock price trends using LSTM deep learning models. Historical data is collected from Yahoo Finance and processed with technical indicators like Moving Average and RSI. The system visualizes actual vs predicted prices to help analyze stock market trends.
Overview

This project predicts stock price trends using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks. Historical stock data is collected from Yahoo Finance, preprocessed, and used to train a deep learning model that forecasts future price movements and visualizes actual vs predicted trends.

Objectives

Collect historical stock price data

Preprocess and normalize time-series data

Build and train an LSTM-based deep learning model

Predict future stock price trends

Visualize actual vs predicted stock prices

🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow / Keras

NumPy, Pandas

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib

Yahoo Finance API (yfinance)

Google Colab

 Methodology

Data Collection – Fetch historical stock data using Yahoo Finance

Preprocessing – Handle missing values and normalize data

Feature Engineering – Use technical indicators like Moving Average and RSI

Model Building – LSTM neural network with dropout layers

Training – Train model using historical data

Prediction – Forecast stock price trends

Visualization – Plot actual vs predicted prices

 How to Run (Google Colab)

Open Google Colab

Upload stock_prediction.ipynb

Run all cells sequentially

The model will train and display prediction graphs

Saved model file: lstm_stock_model.keras

Results

The LSTM model learns historical price patterns and predicts future trends with good accuracy. The prediction curve closely follows actual stock prices, demonstrating effective time-series learning.

 Limitations

Market volatility affects prediction accuracy

External factors like news and sentiment are not considered

Best suited for trend prediction, not exact prices

 Future Scope

Integrate news and sentiment analysis

Deploy using Streamlit web dashboard

Add more technical indicators

Extend to cryptocurrency and forex markets
